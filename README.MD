# Loremaster NPC

_This module was created for [StygianCore](https://rebrand.ly/stygiancoreproject). A World of Warcraft 3.3.5a Solo/LAN repack by StygianTheBest | [GitHub](https://rebrand.ly/stygiangithub) | [Website](https://rebrand.ly/stygianthebest))_

## Description

This places a Loremaster NPC in the game world at various locations who recants the lore of the old
world and brings back the lost memories of so many that sacrificed their lives for this ravaged land
we all call home.

Many of you may know of the website [Warcraft Less Traveled](http://warcraftlesstraveled.com) which was
a Podcast site where the host, Skolnick, discussed various areas in the game, mostly pre-Cata, that
were considered hidden gems. As a Vanilla player and pre-Cata Loremaster/Seeker myself, I knew of
every place he discussed and quite a few he didn't. My plan is to add all of these places into this
module for players to explore and learn about.

As of the release of this module, I have only had time to create three of these NPCs, 
and hope that the community can contribute. I have written the module so adding new 
Loremaster NPCs is done purely in the database and will chain to one another 
automatically if done correctly.
